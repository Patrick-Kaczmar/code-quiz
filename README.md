# code-quiz

This code quiz was made using minimal html and css and focuses mostly on utilizing javascript to manipulate the original html and css pages. This project was made to help reinforce my knowledge of using javascript to create new elements and traverse the DOM, aswell as using local storage to store data.

The goal of the user for this code quiz is to answer the questions as fast as they can and not lose time on the one minute timer. Answering a question wrong will decrease the timer until it hits 0.
